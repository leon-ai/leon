## Current State

### Why is there a small amount of contributors?

I'm taking a lot of time to work on the new core of Leon due to personal reasons. I can only work on it after work and on weekends. Hence, **I'm blocking any potential contribution as the whole core of Leon is coming with many breaking changes**. Many of you are willing to contribute to Leon (create new skills, help to improve the core, translations, and so on...), a big thanks to every one of you!

While I would love to devote more time to Leon, I'm currently unable to do so because I have bills to pay. I have some ideas about how to monetize Leon in the future (Leon's core will always remain open source), but before to get there there is still a long way to go.

Until then, any financial support by [sponsoring Leon](http://sponsor.getleon.ai) is much appreciated üôÇ

### How about large language models and Leon?

Since AI gained in popularity and large language models are getting more and more traction, many of you joined our community. A huge welcome to all of you! ü§ó

At the moment, Leon's NLU will remain intents first with his own model without relying on an LLM. It is important that Leon can run 100% offline and I'm confident that with the downsizing techniques such as quantization Leon will sooner or later work with LLMs at his core and still be able to run on edge.

Here is how LLMs may help Leon in the future:

- Intent fallback: when an utterance cannot match an intent, then rely on an LLM to provide results.
- New named entity recognition engine: provide a better solution to extract entities from utterances such as fruits, numbers, cities, durations, persons, etc.
- Skill features: let skills leverage LLMs to provide out-of-the-box NLP features such as summarization, knowledge base, translation, sentiment analysis, and so on...
- Skill building: LLMs can help to develop skills such as paraphrasing utterance samples, translating answers, converting code from our Python bridge to the upcoming JavaScript bridge and vice versa, etc.
- More...

### What's Next?

Once the new core is released, we'll work on the community aspect of Leon. For example, better organize [our Discord](https://discord.gg/MNQqqKg), plan regular calls, work on skills together, etc. It is very important for Leon to have a real community. At that moment, the skills platform will already be online, so it'll be easier to sync our progress and publish new skills.

- Feel free to check out the Git development branches and our [next major milestones](https://blog.getleon.ai/a-much-better-nlp-and-future-1-0-0-beta-7/#whats-next).
- And the [detailed roadmap](http://roadmap.getleon.ai).
- Many exciting things are coming up, hence no new documentation and tests are going to be written until the official release of Leon.

## üëã Introduction

**Leon** is an **open-source personal assistant** who can live **on your server**.

He **does stuff** when you **ask him to**.

You can **talk to him** and he can **talk to you**.
You can also **text him** and he can also **text you**.
If you want to, Leon can communicate with you by being **offline to protect your privacy**.

### Why?

> 1. If you are a developer (or not), you may want to build many things that could help in your daily life.
>    Instead of building a dedicated project for each of those ideas, Leon can help you with his
>    Skills structure.
> 2. With this generic structure, everyone can create their own skills and share them with others.
>    Therefore there is only one core (to rule them all).
> 3. Leon uses AI concepts, which is cool.
> 4. Privacy matters, you can configure Leon to talk with him offline. You can already text him without any third-party services.
> 5. Open source is great.

### What is this repository for?

> This repository contains the following nodes of Leon:
>
> - The server
> - Skills
> - The web app
> - The hotword node
> - The TCP server (for inter-process communication between Leon and third-party nodes such as spaCy)
> - The Python bridge (the connector between the core and skills made with Python)

### What is Leon able to do?

> Today, the most interesting part is about his core and the way he can scale up. He is pretty young but can easily scale to have new features (skills).
> You can find what he is able to do by browsing the [skills list](https://github.com/leon-ai/leon/tree/develop/skills).<br>
> Please do know that after the official release, we will build many skills along with the community. Feel free to [join us on Discord](https://discord.gg/MNQqqKg) to be part of the journey.

You can also contribute by [sponsoring Leon](http://sponsor.getleon.ai).

Please note that I dedicate most of my free time to Leon.

By sponsoring the project you make the project sustainable and faster to develop features.

The focus is not only limited to the activity you see on GitHub but also a lot of thinking about the direction of the project. Which is naturally related to the overall design, architecture, vision, learning process, and so on...
